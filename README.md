# Clover
An incremental game I'm working on.

The basic idea is that you start with normal 3-leaf clovers and breed them.  Mutations will randomly happen, and there are 7 different 'genes' that can mutate.  Once you get a clover with all 7 genes mutated, you win!

Along the way, you'll increase chances of mutation, inventory size, number of breeding boxes, etc.
